# Multicollinearity Analysis on 50 Startups Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect **multicollinearity** in the 50 Startups dataset using:

* Correlation Heatmap
* Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
* Python Libraries

Multicollinearity is an important assumption in Multiple Linear Regression.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify and analyze multicollinearity between independent variables using:

* Correlation Matrix
* Heatmap Visualization
* VIF Calculation

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Dataset Name:** 50_Startups.csv

**Features:**

* R&D Spend
* Administration
* Marketing Spend
* State
* Profit

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels

---

## 📊 Output

### Correlation Heatmap

Shows relationship between variables.

### VIF Table

Shows multicollinearity level.

### VIF Graph

Visual representation of VIF values.

---

## ▶ How to Run

Step 1:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```

Step 2:

Run the Python file:

```bash
python multicollinearity.py
```

---

## 📈 Result

No severe multicollinearity was found in the dataset.

All VIF values were within acceptable limits.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome
